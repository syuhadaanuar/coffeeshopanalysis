# Rendezvous Cafe Performance Insight
_The goal of this project is to investigate the performance of the company running to sustain growth and success of the company._

<p>Rendezvous Cafe was founded in early 2022 with the aim of creating a place where customers could "rendezvous" for a variety of purposes—be it socializing, working, or simply enjoying a quiet moment. The cafe quickly expanded to three branches in Cheras, Cyberjaya, and Shah Alam. In September 2022, Rendezvous Cafe underwent a significant change in its management and leadership. </p>

<p>After six months, the new management team would like to assess the company’s performance following improvements in daily operations, marketing strategies and customer experience. The company performance has been measured by 3 metrics which are sales, customer and product.</p>

The dashboard shows the monthly sales performance over a six-month period.

#### _Insight_

1\. Sales for the Coffee shops dropped in the second month, February and showed a steady recovery from March through June. The profit margin percentage fluctuates slightly but remains around the 23% over the month. The lowest margin is in March at 22.97% and the highest is in January and June at 23.09% and 23.08%, respectively.

2\. The sales are relatively evenly distributed among the three locations with no single location dominating the total sales and each contributing approximately 33% to the total revenue.

3\. The growth rate shows a lot of fluctuation, moving from negative growth to a steep rise, and then slowing again. February (-6.97%) and June (6.02%) show negative growth, while March (29.82%) and May(31.81%) are high-growth periods.

4\. Coffee and Tea product categories are the top 2 highest profit margins at 39.65% and 27.50% respectively. Coffee beans, bakery, and drinking chocolate fall in the mid-range with margins around 10%, while categories like flavours, loose tea, and packaged chocolate have very low margins below 1%.

#### _Key Takeaways_

1\. Even though the sales figures fluctuate month to month, the profit margin remains relatively stable, suggesting that the business has managed to maintain consistent pricing and cost control. The stable profit margin despite fluctuating sales could indicate good operational efficiency or consistent cost management.

2\. The consistent sales contribution percentage across different locations indicate that the business has a well-balanced customer base across these regions. Other than that, could be due to effective management, similar demand patterns, or uniformity in the products and services offered.

3\. The growth rate shows a lot of fluctuation, moving from negative growth to a steep rise, and then slowing again. This may be tied to external factors such as promotions, seasonality, or market demand shifts.

4\. Coffee and tea category have the highest profit margins, making them the company's most profitable products

#### _Recommendation_

1\. **Expand Product Offerings:** Introduce seasonal or limited-time items to create excitement and draw in customers. For example, offer special holiday-themed drinks or pastries. You could also consider adding higher-margin items like gourmet coffee blends or artisanal teas. Consider adding healthier or niche options, such as vegan or gluten-free products, to attract a broader customer base.

2\. **Optimize Peak Hours:** Extend business hours during peak times, such as early mornings or weekends, to maximize sales. Consider offering special promotions during off-peak hours to attract more customers.

3\. **Social Media Marketing:** Use social media platforms to promote your coffee shop, share updates on new menu items, and engage with customers. Consider running social media ads targeting local audiences to increase visibility.

4\. **Collaborate with local Businesses:** Create co-branded products with local businesses. For example, partner with a local bakery to feature their pastries in your shop, marketed as a special collaboration item. Alternatively, work with a local roaster to create a unique coffee blend exclusive to your shop. This approach can increase foot traffic, enhance brand visibility, and build strong community ties.

5\. **Workplace Outreach:** Target businesses and office complexes in each location by offering corporate packages or catering services. Providing discounts for bulk orders or subscriptions for regular coffee deliveries could help tap into the corporate market.
