# Rendezvous Cafe Performance Insight
_The goal of this project is to investigate the performance of the company running to sustain growth and success of the company._

<p>Rendezvous Cafe was founded in early 2022 with the aim of creating a place where customers could "rendezvous" for a variety of purposes—be it socializing, working, or simply enjoying a quiet moment. The cafe quickly expanded to three branches in Cheras, Cyberjaya, and Shah Alam. In September 2022, Rendezvous Cafe underwent a significant change in its management and leadership. </p>

<p>After six months, the new management team would like to assess the company’s performance following improvements in daily operations, marketing strategies and customer experience. The company performance has been measured by 3 metrics which are sales, customer and product.</p>

**Project Background :** The analysis was conducted by using Excel, with the data sourced from the Kaggle website.</p>

The dashboard shows the sales performance over a six-month period.

#### _Insight_

1\. Sales for the Coffee shops dropped in the second month, February and showed a steady recovery from March through June. The profit margin percentage fluctuates slightly but remains around the 23% over the month. The lowest margin is in March at 22.97% and the highest is in January and June at 23.09% and 23.08%, respectively.

2\. The sales are relatively evenly distributed among the three locations with no single location dominating the total sales and each contributing approximately 33% to the total revenue.

3\. The growth rate shows a lot of fluctuation, moving from negative growth to a steep rise, and then slowing again. February (-6.97%) and June (6.02%) show negative growth, while March (29.82%) and May(31.81%) are high-growth periods.

4\. Coffee and Tea product categories are the top 2 highest profit margins at 39.65% and 27.50% respectively. Coffee beans, bakery, and drinking chocolate fall in the mid-range with margins around 10%, while categories like flavours, loose tea, and packaged chocolate have very low margins below 1%.

#### _Key Takeaways_

1\. Even though the sales figures fluctuate month to month, the profit margin remains relatively stable, suggesting that the business has managed to maintain consistent pricing and cost control. The stable profit margin despite fluctuating sales could indicate good operational efficiency or consistent cost management.

2\. The consistent sales contribution percentage across different locations indicate that the business has a well-balanced customer base across these regions. Other than that, could be due to effective management, similar demand patterns, or uniformity in the products and services offered.

3\. The growth rate shows a lot of fluctuation, moving from negative growth to a steep rise, and then slowing again. This may be tied to external factors such as promotions, seasonality, or market demand shifts.

4\. Coffee and tea category have the highest profit margins, making them the company's most profitable products

#### _Recommendation_

1\. **Expand Product Offerings:** Introduce seasonal or limited-time items to create excitement and draw in customers. For example, offer special holiday-themed drinks or pastries. You could also consider adding higher-margin items like gourmet coffee blends or artisanal teas. Consider adding healthier or niche options, such as vegan or gluten-free products, to attract a broader customer base.

2\. **Optimize Peak Hours:** Extend business hours during peak times, such as early mornings or weekends, to maximize sales. Consider offering special promotions during off-peak hours to attract more customers.

3\. **Social Media Marketing:** Use social media platforms to promote your coffee shop, share updates on new menu items, and engage with customers. Consider running social media ads targeting local audiences to increase visibility.

4\. **Collaborate with local Businesses:** Create co-branded products with local businesses. For example, partner with a local bakery to feature their pastries in your shop, marketed as a special collaboration item. Alternatively, work with a local roaster to create a unique coffee blend exclusive to your shop. This approach can increase foot traffic, enhance brand visibility, and build strong community ties.

5\. **Workplace Outreach:** Target businesses and office complexes in each location by offering corporate packages or catering services. Providing discounts for bulk orders or subscriptions for regular coffee deliveries could help tap into the corporate market.

## **Customer**

The dashboard shows the customer purchase performance over a six-month period.

#### _Insight_

1\. The daily customer count remains fairly stable throughout the month which suggests a consistent flow of customers on most days, fluctuating between 2,400 and 2,900 customers. But there is a sharp decline in customer visits towards the end of the month, particularly on the 31st day, where the count drops to 1,228 customers.

2\. There is a clear upward trend in the number of repeat customers from January to June, significantly from 1,170 in January to 9,085 in June. The number of new customers shows some fluctuation over the months. It starts at 8,532 in January, decreases in February to 6,066, and then hovers around 5,940 to 6,625 from March to June.

3\. Across all three locations, Shah Alam has the highest number of new and repeat customers, followed by Cheras then Cyberjaya.

4\. Average customer spending fluctuates month-to-month. May has the highest average customer spending  with RM24.53 and June exhibits the lowest average customer spending at RM20.96.

5\. Coffee has the highest sales (RM752,876.30) and a significant number of customers (23,554), indicating it is the most popular product category and a major revenue driver. Packaged Chocolate has the lowest sales (RM5,359.00) despite having 471 customers, indicating either low pricing or infrequent purchases in this category.

#### _Key Takeaways_

1\. The sharp drop in customer visits on the 31st day could be a few factors of end of month seasonality where related to budget constraints, where people might be spending less as they approach the end of the month. Other than that, customer fatigue where regular customers might have skipped a visit due to fatigue or having visited recently.

2\. The significant increase in repeat customers is a positive sign of customer retention, but maintaining a balance between acquiring new customers and retaining existing ones is crucial for sustained growth.

3\. With focused efforts on increasing new customer inflow and maintaining high service standards, there is strong potential for sustained growth across all stores. 

4\. High average customer spending in May doesn’t necessarily lead to the highest total revenue for that month compared to June. Customer behavior would be the factor where repeat customers might be contributing significantly to the total revenue. Strong base of repeat customers and their frequent visits could drive up the monthly totals, even if their average spending per visit is lower.

5\. The overall sales performance of each product category is significantly driven by the number of customers it draws in. Coffee Bean category recorded an interesting insight where having moderate customer base figure but average spending per customer is relatively high.The data suggests that Coffee Beans are appealing to a specific segment of customers, likely those who prefer brewing their own coffee at home rather than purchasing ready-made drinks. This niche market is smaller but willing to spend more per transaction.

#### _Recommendation_

1\. **Customer Loyalty Programs :** Implement a loyalty program that rewards repeat customers with discounts or free items after a certain number of purchases. This encourages customer retention and increases the lifetime value of each customer.

2\. **Leverage Data and Feedback:** Use customer feedback to identify areas for improvement. Regularly conduct surveys or encourage reviews to gather insights on what customers like and what could be improved. In return, provide vouchers to customers on the next purchase to encourage more feedback.

3\. **Improve Customer Service:** Ensure that your staff provides exceptional service to enhance customer satisfaction and encourage repeat visits. Happy customers are more likely to become regulars and refer others.

4\. **Expand the Product Range:** Since the coffee bean niche market is willing to spend more, introduce new varieties of Coffee Beans, such as single-origin, organic, or fair-trade options. Offer bundle deals that pair a variety of Coffee Beans in a package. Offering a wider selection could attract more customers with diverse tastes.

5\. **Offer First-Time Discounts:** To attract new customers, provide a discount or a free item to first-time customers. This can be advertised through social media, online ads, or even local flyers.

4\. Across all three beverage categories (coffee, tea, and drinking chocolate), regular and large sizes are more popular than smaller options. Customers appear to value larger servings, potentially due to perceived better value or higher satisfaction from bigger portions.

#### _Recommendation_

1\. **Capacity Planning:** Given the increasing trend in product quantity sold, it may be wise to ensure that inventory and supply chains are prepared to meet potentially higher demand in the coming months.

2\. **Expand Coffee Offerings:** Given the strong preference for coffee, consider expanding the range of coffee options, possibly introducing new gourmet or specialty blends.
